Jakarta Mail 2.1 / Angus Mail 1.0
    1. What is Jakarta Mail
The Jakarta Mail API provides a set of abstract classes defining objects that comprise a mail system. The API defines classes like Message, Store and Transport. The API can be extended and can be subclassed to provide new protocols and to add functionality when necessary.
In addition, the API provides concrete subclasses of the abstract classes. These subclasses, including MimeMessage and MimeBodyPart, implement widely used Internet mail protocols and conform to specifications RFC822 and RFC2045. They are ready to be used in application development.
